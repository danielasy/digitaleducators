# digitaleducators
CSC309 project


## Getting Started
First you will have to install Meteor. Don't worry, Meteor already provides MongoDB
for you. No starting mongo daemon with "mongod"! Yay!

https://www.meteor.com/install


After installing Meteor, clone the repository of our project (aka me).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eh-am/digitaleducators.git
```

Finally, just start the application, by running:
```
$ cd digitaleducators
$ meteor
=> Started proxy.
=> Started MongoDB.
=> Started your app.

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
```

## Next Steps

You don't have to worry about restarting your server, 'cause Meteor does that for you!
Isn't that awesome? 

Maybe you should read (and try) the [Meteor Tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app) to understand how Meteor works and stuff. You're gonna love it.
