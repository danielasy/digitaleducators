# digitaleducators
CSC309 project


## Getting Started
First you will have to install Meteor. Don't worry, it already provides MongoDB
for you. No starting mongo daemon with "mongod"! Yay!

https://www.meteor.com/install


Then, clone this repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eh-am/digitaleducators.git
```

Then, just start the application, by running:
```
$ meteor
=> Started proxy.
=> Started MongoDB.
=> Started your app.

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
```
